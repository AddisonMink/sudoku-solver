# Sudoku Solver
This is a small project I did while learning JavaScript. It solves sudoku puzzles. You can play with it here: http://addisonmink.net/sudoku-solver/sudoku.html.

You can enter a puzzle by filling in the cells of the grid. You can also enter a puzzle in string form by contatenating the rows of the puzzle and using '.'s as a placeholder for empty cells. For example the string '85...24..72......9..4.........1.7..23.5...9...4...........8..7..17..........36.4.' generates the puzzle show below.
